TITLE: Moving Eyes

DESCRIPTION:
Eyes follow the user's mouse around the page.

Creating a script for moving eyes was originally part of an assignment from MIT Xpro. They provided starter code and I completed the missing code to create functionality. I added a few layers for fun. An portrait image with transparent eyes and a gold frame. The divs were centered with CSS grid. 

TO RUN: Download the files and open them in your browser. Eyes will automically follow your cursor.

ROADMAP:
Add more portraits a user could toggle between. 
Add a row for instructions at the top and a column on the left for images to select. 
Roadbumps: This would require a dom understanding of where they portraits' eyes are, and how far apart they are.
