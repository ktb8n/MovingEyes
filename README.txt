TITLE: Moving Eyes

DESCRIPTION:
Eyes follow the user's mouse around the page.

Creating a script for moving eyes was originally part of an assignment from MIT Xpro. They provided starter code and I completed the missing code to create functionality. I added a few layers for fun. An portrait image with transparent eyes and a gold frame. The divs were centered with CSS grid. 

GOALS:
Right now there is one column and one row, but eventually it would be cool to add more portraits a user could toggle between. I would add a row for instructions at the top and a column on the left for images to select. I imagine I'll run into problems having the eyes from the portrait image line up with where the moving eyes are currently positioned.

PIE IN THE SKY:
Choose between different portraits. This would require a dom understanding of where they portraits' eyes are, and how far apart they are.
